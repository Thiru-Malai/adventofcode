# Advent Of Code

This repo contains the answers for the problems I have solved.
I have categorized by year and the # of the problem. If a problem has different parts then it will have it's solution in a different file under the problem # folder. For example, part 1 will be named as 1_problem_name.cpp & part 2 as 2_problem_name.cpp

# How to run?

First compile the cpp files (compiled files are already there):
<br>
`$ g++ name.cpp name`
<br>
which generates the .exe file 
<br>
`$ ./name` 
<br>
runs the program.
