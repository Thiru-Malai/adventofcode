# Advent Of Code

This repo contains the answers for the problems I have solved.
Each part will have it's solution in a different file. For example, part 1 will be named as 1_problem_name.cpp & part 2 as 2_problem_name.cpp

# How to run?

First compile the cpp files (compiled files are already there):
`$ g++ name.cpp name`
which generates the .exe file
`$ ./name`
runs the program.
